            <p>This passage is discussing the flexibility and expectations for individuals who are part of a freelance or task-based work arrangement. Here's an elaboration of its key points:</p>
            <li>Freedom to Accept or Decline Tasks: You have the freedom to decide whether you want to accept or decline the tasks that are assigned to you. This means you have the autonomy to choose which assignments you take on.</li>
            <li>Familiarity with Tasks and Training: It is important that you are well-acquainted with all the tasks you're assigned and that you have completed any training modules provided to you. This ensures that you are prepared and capable of handling the tasks effectively.</li>
            <li>Hourly Rate: As you continue to grow in your professional journey and take on new jobs, the company will require proof of your current hourly rate. The company's philosophy is to always aim to match or exceed the rate you're currently earning. This reflects their commitment to providing fair compensation.</li>
            <li>Flexibility to Decline Tasks: If you find yourself busy due to work or personal commitments and are unable to take on any tasks, you can inform Paathshala that you are currently unavailable. This means you can take a break when needed, and you're not obligated to accept tasks during busy periods.
            </li>
            <li>Reaching Out for Work Opportunities: Once you have free time again and are available to take on tasks, you are encouraged to reach out to the company for potential work opportunities. This implies an open and flexible arrangement where you can resume working when it suits your schedule.</li>
            <p>In summary, the passage emphasizes the flexibility of the work arrangement, the importance of being prepared for assigned tasks, and the company's commitment to fair compensation. It also highlights the ease of taking breaks when needed and the option to resume work when availability allows.</p>
